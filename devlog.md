# Devlog - Haiku Writer

## 2026-02-23
- set up the project with vite (to set up reactjs frontend)
- i'm using express for the backend, which makes api calls easier
- also using axios in the front-end, which allows for making api calls to server
- had problems with versions / dependencies - npm showing security flaws, but these were for eslint, which won't reach production, so they won't affect the security of the final application
- i resolved this by choosing to leave these vulnerabilities so i could still use axios
- followed this tutorial to set up the project (but will be departing from this soon)
